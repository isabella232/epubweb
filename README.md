Advancing Portable Documents for the Open Web Platform: EPUB-WEB
===============================================================

***This Repo should be considered as closed now. The work has been transferred to the [DPUB Interest Group](http://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/) and is now part of the deliverables of that group. See the [new repo](https://github.com/w3c/dpub-pwd) for the continuation work. (2015-09-26)***

This is the repo for a White Paper on EPUB-WEB. 

The latest “published” version of the White Paper is the[index.html](index.html) file; to view the document properly rendered in a browser, use the [”paged” version](http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/). The repository contains also copies of previous, “stable” versions. Finally, the current [development draft](draft/index.html) is also available for comments.

There is also a [presentation slide set](./presentation/index.html); again, it is better to use the [”paged” version](http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/presentation/) or, alternatively, a [PDF version](http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/presentation/slides.pdf).

We welcome comments on the White Paper. You can either send us a mail (see below), raise an [issue on github](https://github.com/w3c/epubweb/issues) or send us a pull request (with a preference for the former). Thank you!

Markus Gylling (<mgylling@idpf.org>), Ivan Herman (<ivan@w3.org>).
